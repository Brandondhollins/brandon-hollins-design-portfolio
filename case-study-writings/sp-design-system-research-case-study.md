This plan served as a roadmap for conducting the research and ensured that the study would be conducted systematically and effectively. By starting with a well-defined research plan, I was able to lay the groundwork for a successful research endeavor and set clear objectives for gathering insights from designers.

I formulated targeted research questions that dive deep into its usage, challenges, and potential areas for improvement. I categorized the research questions into three distinct groups: "Must-Know", "Nice-to-Know", and "Already-Know" - each tailored to uncover different layers of insights.

The "Must-Know" questions I developed are foundational, focusing on the clarity, usability, and how well the design system integrates into the workflows of designers. These questions examine the ease of using components, the need for creating new elements outside the established system, and how well designers and engineers are synchronized in using the system. Additionally, I probed into the system’s accessibility features and its support for content design and strategy, along with assessing the correlation between designers' confidence and their frequency of using the system.

The "Nice-to-Know" questions I crafted delve into more nuanced areas. I explored factors that contribute to the increased time spent on component and pattern selection, identified the common challenges faced by designers, and investigated how the design system could better support creative thinking and problem-solving. These questions also aimed to understand communication nuances with engineers, especially regarding component styling and usage, and to evaluate the familiarity with and impact of tools like Figma's Dev Mode on the collaborative process.

Lastly, the "Already-Know" questions I set out were to establish a baseline understanding of the current usage of the design system. These questions measured designers' confidence in the system, the frequency of clarification requests they receive, the time invested in component selection and brainstorming, and their overall perception of the system's usefulness.
