# SimplePractice Dark Mode Color System

I developed a robust and thoughtfully designed color palette, which provided our engineers with detailed designs and, crucially, elevated the user experience for those utilizing dark mode on our mobile platform.

I developed a well-crafted color palette for dark mode in the SimplePractice universal App. The previous color palette was ineffective and lacked user-friendliness. With the utilization of Adobe's Leonardo tool, I was able to generate an adaptive color palette based on perceptual color models. This new color palette meets specific contrast ratios and accessibility guidelines, ensuring visually appealing and legible designs under various light conditions. The implementation of this meticulously curated and accessible color palette streamlines design processes for the engineering team and significantly enhances the user experience for mobile customers using dark mode. By meeting accessibility standards and delivering a thoughtfully designed, immersive experience, SimplePractice is better positioned to provide an exceptional dark mode user experience.

Mobile design and engineering necessitate a meticulously crafted color palette for dark mode. Our present color palette is inefficient and not user-friendly. We required a robust and thoughtfully planned color palette to provide our engineers with comprehensive designs and, more importantly, to enhance the experience of our dark mode mobile users. I watched a presentation by the Asana design system team at the 2021 Figma Schema Conference. They explained their process for creating a dark mode for their product. This presentation was my favorite from Schema 2021, so I had already watched it multiple times. I expected creating a dark mode color system to be a simple and systematic task. I never gave it much thought, assuming it was just a matter of inverting and adjusting the colors from the light mode. However, I was completely mistaken, as I learned from this keynote and by correctly implementing it for my own project.

After delving into the depths of iconography, I learned to never underestimate any discipline in design again. I recognized that color theory was no different. I also came to the realization that I was a level five designer taking on a level twenty mission. This situation was less than ideal for most entry-level designers, given that I was self-taught and had several knowledge gaps. However, I welcomed the challenge. This meant that I had to either elevate myself to a level twenty designer by the end of this project or start seeking a new role.

I conducted extensive research and studied the Human Interface Guidelines and Material Design Guidelines. This allowed me to gain a comprehensive understanding of how color should be used in interface design, particularly in the context of dark mode.
The Human Interface Guidelines provide best practices and recommendations for designing user interfaces on Apple platforms, including iOS and iPadOS. These guidelines emphasize the importance of creating visually appealing and accessible designs that enhance the user experience. In the case of dark mode, the guidelines provide specific recommendations for adapting colors, maintaining contrast ratios, and ensuring legibility in low light environments.

Similarly, the Material Design Guidelines provide guidance for designing interfaces across different platforms, including Android. These guidelines focus on creating consistent, intuitive, and visually engaging experiences. They offer insights into color usage, including how to create color palettes that work well in both light and dark modes. By studying these guidelines, I gained valuable knowledge about the principles and considerations for designing effective color systems in dark mode.

Leonardo Color is designed to help create adaptable color systems in line with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). It is named in honor of Leonardo da Vinci, given his significant contributions to the understanding of human visual perception.Leonardo Color allows designers to produce color palettes, particularly for data visualizations, that maintain the desired contrast ratios throughout. This is especially important in terms of accessibility, ensuring that people with visual impairments are still able to interact with and understand the given visualization.

I became frustrated after attempting to learn how to use Leonardo for a few days and not getting anywhere. While watching Nate Baldwinâ€™s videos, I felt like I understood, yet I kept getting confused when I tried to use the tool myself. I thought that color would be so simple, but it was not at all. I had to learn so many new things about color, such as hue, lightness stops, and contrast ratios. After confusing myself trying to explain my process, I connected with Nate Baldwin, the creator of the Leonardo tool, to better understand the tool and the concept of color in general. Nate Baldwin has made significant contributions to the field of color and accessibility, and his Leonardo Color tool is widely used for creating adaptable color palettes that meet accessibility standards. Through our conversation, I gained valuable insights into the importance of color contrast and its role in creating accessible designs.

Previously, I held the belief that obtaining the correct contrast ratio for a project necessitated utilizing a specific formula or equation. However, after a discussion with Nate, I came to understand that it was more of a personal preference than an absolute rule, as long as the contrast met the guidelines outlined by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

Nate built a website called "Color and Contrast," which became my go-to resource during this project. By studying the website, I realized I didn't fully understand color. After revisiting the Human Interface Guidelines and Material Design Guidelines, it felt like I was seeing clearly for the first time with glasses on. After talking to Nate, I finally realized that I did not understand lightness stops. I knew what they were, but I never heard anyone refer to lightness stops by their correct name. Even after learning what it is called, I still haven't read or watched anything where a designer referred to it as a lightness stop. When a color has variants like "ocean-500" and "ocean-600," those are lightness stops. It refers to a specific point or value along the lightness scale of a color palette.

After learning that there was no magic equation and that the contrast ratio was up to me, I generated several dark mode color palettes with a similar ratio to our current light mode color pallet. I did this by importing our current color library using the hex codes of each color. I collaborated with Peter B. Chung, the Design System Lead, to develop the Figma variables for our new dark mode color system. Although we had to make some alterations towards the end, we managed to successfully switch between light and dark mode with ease during our variable iteration process. Out of all the projects I have worked on in my short design career, I would say that I learned the most during this project. It was particularly challenging because I had to balance it with the Toast Redesign project at the same time. I experienced something like a design existential crisis when I discovered the depth of color. Before, I had only heard about contrast, saturation, hue, and so on, but there is so much more to it. And I want to learn everything there is to know.
