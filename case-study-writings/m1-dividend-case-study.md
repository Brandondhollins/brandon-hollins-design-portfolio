# M1 Dividend Simplification

During my internship at M1 Finance, the intern squad worked towards solving user pain points around dividends on the M1 platform. My team and I focused on improving three areas where dividend information was lacking: explaining negative dividends, showing the status of earned dividends, and displaying historical dividends.

I worked with seven other interns in product and engineering during the internship. It was a great experience. I met with web engineers and our team's product manager almost daily to conduct design QA and discuss different design decisions that I made. It was also nice to work so closely with the engineers because they would point out my blind spots. For example, I forgot to design for different states, such as empty and error states. I went into my internship with the goal of improving my visual design and interaction design skills, as well as my collaboration skills. By working with so many engineers as a designer, I definitely improved in these areas.

The dividend improvements yielded promising results. While the specifics of post-internship data remain confidential due to an NDA, we noticed an encouraging near 20% uptick in user engagement with the dividend features. Further testament to our success was the palpable positive buzz within public domains like the m1 Facebook group and Reddit community. Discussions flourished around these improved features, with users praising the enhanced clarity and transparency.

During my three-month internship, I set three smart goals to guide my professional development and contributions. My first goal was to develop a robust understanding of the M1 product. To achieve this, I continuously learned about the M1 product, its users, and the overarching goals of both the business and its user base.

My second goal focused on acquiring interaction design skills. This objective was pursued by creating user and task flows for the existing M1 finance product and the dividend project. This approach not only allowed me to gain practical experience but also enabled me to apply the theoretical knowledge I had acquired.

Lastly, my third goal was centered around learning how to work effectively with product managers and engineers. Over the course of the internship, I actively participated in team activities and contributed to various projects. This involvement provided me with an in-depth understanding of the roles and functions of product managers and engineers within the company. Through these efforts, I hoped to cultivate productive and mutually beneficial relationships with my colleagues and make meaningful contributions to the team.

By solving problems surrounding dividends, M1 was hoping to experience a decrease in support tickets and drive new user growth. The dividend project was prioritized in the first place because there was an increase in support tickets regarding dividends, ranging from confusion about the difference between earned and paid dividends to requesting more information about their dividends. The current M1 product does not put much emphasis on dividends. Negative dividends are shown on the activity page without explanation, confusing users because they do not know what they are. On the portfolio page, the total amount of earned dividends is displayed, with neither an indication of what company they came from nor how much. Considering my team and I were unfamiliar with the problems that users were facing, we had to do some digging. The product manager and I talked to several different people. We started with user research and talking to other departments throughout the company, such as the content strategy manager, client success, and marketing. Throughout these meetings, we started to see similarities and common problems that users faced. Common problems were confusion about earned vs. Paid dividends, the status of dividends, the timeframe from earned to paid, and users wanting to see how their dividends performed over time.

To kick off our project, my team had a design workshop where we brainstormed and discussed the current problems surrounding dividends on a broad scale and worked toward potential, actionable solutions. This workshop aims to bring the intern pod together to generate ideas and converge on possible solutions. At the end of the workshop, we concluded that we would focus on three areas: explaining negative dividends, showing the status of earned dividends, and displaying historical dividends. Based on the results of the dot voting, we decided to focus on one of the problem areas in three different sprints. As seen below, we documented them in the form of the three how might we statements:

1. How might we explain negative dividends?
2. How might we break down earned dividends?
3. How might we display users’ dividend history?

There are three different types of negative dividends: ADR fee, foreign tax, and a reversal. Before the implementation of this feature, users did not receive an explanation of negative dividends, only so a deduction from their account. This caused them to constantly be confused, which in turn caused several complaints to customer success. Since there were multiple types, we decided that a tooltip would be the best solution to the confusion caused by negative dividends. Our original plan was to design three different tooltips explaining a particular negative dividend type. We had to change the original copy of the different negative dividends because of some backend constraints. During a meeting with our backend engineer, we learned that we could not decipher the difference between a foreign tax and a reversal. To solve this, we combined them into one tooltip called “deduction,” which explained what a reversal and foreign tax is and that it could be either. Users were uncertain about the difference between earned and paid dividends, the status of earned dividends, and the timeframe from earning to payment. One issue was that the total amount of earned dividends was displayed on the portfolio page without any indication of which company they came from or how much came from each company. This lack of specificity made it difficult for users to track and understand their dividend earnings accurately. Overall, the insufficient information provided about earned dividends created a lack of transparency and understanding for users. They needed clearer and more detailed information about their dividend earnings, including the breakdown by company. By addressing these issues, M1 could improve the user experience and help users make more informed investment decisions.

Our team's internship lasted only three months, so the project must be completed by the beginning of August. Unfortunately, we didn't manage our time effectively, which put us under pressure during the final stage of the project, specifically when we were working on displaying historical dividends. Additionally, we had to make several changes during the design process and handoff due to limitations in the backend.
For example, on the earned dividend page, we implemented a static time frame. The decision to make the time frame static on the screen showing the breakdown of earned dividends was primarily driven by time constraints. During the development process, we were already running behind schedule, with the project extending beyond the planned sprint duration. As a result, we had limited time to allocate to each feature and had to prioritize certain aspects over others.
Given the time limitations, our team made the decision to make the time frame static in order to save development time and meet the overall project deadline. By implementing a static time frame, we were able to simplify the implementation process and allocate more time to other critical tasks, such as displaying historical dividends.

While the ability to change the time frame would have provided more flexibility to users, it would have required additional development effort and potentially extended the project timeline even further. Considering the trade-off between flexibility and timely delivery, we opted for a static time frame to ensure that we could complete the project within the given time constraints.

Please note that even though the time frame is static, the earned dividend data displayed on the screen still corresponds to the specific time range selected on the previous page. This ensures that users can accurately track their dividend earnings based on their selected time frame. When I first started working on displaying historical dividends, I was filled with a mix of excitement and nerves. While I was eager to dive into this new challenge, I couldn't help but feel a bit apprehensive. After all, this was my first time working with data visualization in a design context. As a computer science student, I had some experience with displaying data using Python, but I hadn't yet explored it from a designer's perspective. The thought of bringing together data and design was both thrilling and intimidating. However, I was determined to overcome any obstacles and deliver a visually compelling and informative experience for our users. With the support of my team and the knowledge I had gained throughout my internship, I was ready to tackle this new territory head-on.

I decided to use an interactive bar chart instead of a line graph like the one used to show the performance of securities for a few reasons:

1. Different data representation: The bar chart and the line graph serve different purposes in visualizing data. The line graph is commonly used to show the trend or changes in a continuous variable over time, such as the performance of securities. On the other hand, the bar chart is more suitable for displaying discrete data, such as the dividend earnings at different time intervals.
2. Clear representation of dividend earnings: The bar chart provides a clear and intuitive representation of dividend earnings. Each bar in the chart corresponds to a specific time period, and its length represents the dividend amount earned during that period. This allows users to easily compare and understand the historical performance of their dividends at a glance.
3. Focus on time-based visualization: Dividends are often received at regular intervals, such as quarterly or annually. The bar chart effectively visualizes how dividend earnings have changed over time, allowing users to identify patterns or trends in their dividend income. This time-based visualization is essential for users to track and analyze their dividend performance effectively.
4. Enhanced interactivity: An interactive bar chart offers more opportunities for users to interact with the data. Users can hover over each bar to view detailed information about the dividend earnings for a specific time period. They can also select specific time periods to focus on, allowing for a more customized and engaging exploration of their dividend history.

Going forward, I want to prioritize communication. Communicating with my team was my most challenging obstacle during the internship. Sometimes, I would update a mobile design with the iOS engineer and forget to mention the changes to the android and web engineers. This led to confusion and inconsistent design. I decided that I needed to share all updates, no matter the platform, with all engineers. Eventually, I adapted and made sure to communicate all design updates during stand-ups.

In retrospect, if I had more time at M1 finance, I would have liked to take the dividend project further. While our team made significant improvements to the m1 dividend experience, it has the potential to be even better. Right now, dividend information is located in several places. If both earned and paid dividend information were in one place, users would have a better experience. The stepper iteration was started. Even if it is impossible today, there is still hope for the future.
