# SimplePractice Icon Refactor

I conducted an audit of the current iconography on the platform, replaced them, documented their use and guidelines, and implemented the new iconography system with the help of engineering. The current suite of icons does not adhere to any standards or guidelines within the design system. While they have served the company well, it is time for an update and refresh. Updating the iconography within the design system will provide a source of truth for both designers and engineers.

I conducted an audit of the current iconography on the platform, replaced them, documented their use and guidelines, and implemented the new iconography system with the help of engineering. The existing suite of icons lacked standardization and consistency with the design system. Recognizing the need for a refresh, I embarked on a journey to update the iconography, thereby creating a unified reference point for both designers and engineers. My role encompassed a comprehensive audit of the current platform's iconography, facilitating their replacement, and documenting the usage guidelines.

Around a year ago, I started my first internship as a Product Design Intern. I worked on a project with an entire team of interns, from product managers to backend engineers. While we had a lot of success, we made a lot of mistakes. I made alot of mistakes.

I conducted an audit of the iconography at SimplePractice, which included both the desktop and mobile versions. Here are some examples of the key findings:

Unclear Iconography Guidelines: There is a lack of clarity in terms of sizing, styling, naming conventions, and when, where, and how to use icons. The current platform utilizes different icon sizes, ranging from 12x12 to 28x28.

Multiple Styles of Iconography Are In Use: The current product employs a mix of filled and outlined styles, with some legacy icons still in use. It is important to decide whether to stick to one style, use a mix, or explore new styles.

Multiple Versions of the Same Icon Are In Use: Various icons, such as calendar, notes, close, edit, upload, create/add, billing, arrows, chevron arrow, and tooltips, have multiple versions being used, leading to inconsistency.

Differences Between Desktop & Mobile Icons: The iconography used in the desktop and mobile versions of SimplePractice differs, with some icons being a blend of both. Additionally, the mobile version integrates iOS and iPadOS native iconography (SF Symbols) and requires icons for both light and dark modes.

Inconsistent Behavior of Iconography - Interactions and Animations: Inconsistencies exist in how icons behave, including interactions, animations, and dropdown styles. Some icons have hover descriptions or button animations, while others lack such features.

Engineering and Iconography: There is a need for better collaboration between engineering and design to ensure smooth implementation and adherence to iconography guidelines.

These findings emphasize the need to address the unclear guidelines, standardize the style of icons, consolidate multiple versions of icons, align desktop and mobile iconography, ensure consistent behavior, and foster closer collaboration between engineering and design teams. After conducting the icon audit and finding replacements, I decided to present my findings to the design team. Going into the meeting, I was expecting designers to ask a lot of questions. I didn’t expect the questions to be so tough.Not being able to answer questions around icons did not feel nice to me. As someone who was refreshing the icon system, I needed to know the answers to those questions. For myself, and for the design team. So i decided to go on a quest.

I started my quest by reading articles and case studies about iconography. But that wasn’t enough. The answers I needed were only possessed by those who practiced the dark magic of iconography. So I went to Twitter. Icon Designers are rare but powerful wizards, and throughout my search, I only found about 4. I sent them a direct message to each of them explaining my dire situation. 2 responded. Meet Bonnie Kate Wolf, Icon Designer at Netflix. And Jory Raphael, Lead Icon Designer at FontAwesome. By meeting with these two, I gained icon knowledge that can’t be found anywhere else.

From the two meetings with Bonnie Kate Wolf and Jory Raphael, I gained valuable insights into the world of iconography. Bonnie highlighted the benefits of using Font Awesome, such as saving time and money with its extensive library and customer service. However, she also mentioned the drawbacks of not having a unique system that can be specifically tailored to a brand.

Regarding duotone icons, Bonnie mentioned that they can have legibility problems and should be used if they fit with the brand's aesthetic. Bounding boxes, according to both Bonnie and Jory, are essential for designers and engineers to have a predictable size for icons and avoid alignment issues.
Creating custom icons was also discussed, with a focus on maintaining consistency in line weight and reaching out to Jory for assistance if needed. Filled icons were noted to be more accessible than outlined icons, as they take up more visual space and maintain legibility at different sizes.
The meetings also addressed questions about when to use icons, the relationship between size and style, and common obstacles in implementing icons. Both Bonnie and Jory emphasized the importance of adding labels to icons, using white space effectively, and ensuring icons improve understanding in an interface.
Overall, these meetings provided me with a deeper understanding of iconography best practices, managing and organizing icons in Figma, and working collaboratively with engineering to implement icons successfully. Afterwards, I shared my learnings with the broader design team, prioritizing those who had questions before.

I gained a great understanding of the ever-evolving nature of design. Balancing the dual demands of creating icons for both end-users and fellow designers taught me the critical importance of user-centric and adaptable design. Iteratively updating icons and introducing new sizes, like the 20px option, underscored the need for flexibility and constant evolution in design systems. Documentation of these changes was not just a task but a vital part of maintaining a coherent design language. This experience reinforced a key lesson: design, especially in a dynamic system, is a continuous, never-ending process that must adapt to meet changing needs and trends.

I learned to highly value the experience of users through research. Gathering insights directly from real people who interact with our products is critically important for informing good design work.
I also recognized the importance of continually improving my skills and craft in tools like Figma. Design systems require strong technical execution, and platforms like Figma are essential for bringing ideas to life and collaborating with others.
I gained a much greater understanding of design systems methodology through working with one directly. The structured approach of reusable components, patterns, and standards proved very valuable.
My visual design capabilities strengthened as well. With experience comes improved ability to translate user needs into elegant, intuitive solutions.
Finally, facilitating meetings and presentations helped advance my communication skills. As design relies on partnership, the ability to engage stakeholders is paramount.
