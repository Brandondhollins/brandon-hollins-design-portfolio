# SimplePractice Toast Redesign

Toast notifications were temporarily released in early 2022 but rolled back due to complaints that they were annoying and appeared in cumbersome areas of the product (top right). There were also some instances of complaints about them being too visually dominant.

In the beginning, I felt disappointed because I was enjoying building a new date picker component. It took me a while to make progress, and I was surprised because toasts seemed straightforward compared to the date picker. However, I soon realized that I was wrong. At present, our informational banners and success banners have identical appearances, even though they are distinct components. This is poor design, and we need to distinguish between a banner and a success message visually. On the average screen size for our user (1440 px), our current success messages cover up links on standard pages, such as the client page, when they appear. Success messages should be non-intrusive and discrete while still drawing attention to communicate to the users that their action succeeded or failed.

At first, I was expected to manually search through every page to locate all the instances of success and error banners. However, I realized that this method was very time-consuming and inefficient. As a solution, I utilized my background in engineering and requested access to the code base. Using Github, I was able to search through the code and locate every instance of any component, making the process of auditing much more efficient.

To organize the information, I created three separate Notion databases for each of the three types of banners: success, error, and alert banners. In these databases, I recorded details such as the type of banner, the action that triggers the banner, the current copy, the new copy, and a link to the instance of the component in the Github repository. A piece of feedback that I constantly received both before and while working at SimplePractice was that I need to show more iterations of my designs and explain why I made certain design decisions. I think that I have always struggled with the ideation phase of design because it is so…open. Figma is literally a white canvas, the possibilities are endless, so it was a bit overwhelming. I think that working on the design system team, building components, and managing them changed that. Focusing on one component, that being the toast in this instance, put me in the zone. There were so many directions we could go visually, with the colors, icons, interactions, and animations.

I leveraged Slack to efficiently collect asynchronous feedback on a series of 12 toast notification prototypes. These prototypes varied in style and placement and included both success and error messages. The key focus of the feedback was to decide between two design options: a white toast with accent colors or a solid-colored version, and to determine the most effective placement for these notifications. The team's responses were insightful, showing a general preference for the less intrusive white/green toast design.

There was also a healthy discussion about the ideal placement of these toasts, with opinions varying between left, middle, and bottom right positions. This experience underscored the effectiveness of using Slack for asynchronous communication, enabling my team to provide well-considered feedback at their own pace, which was invaluable for the decision-making process in the design of the toast notifications. In the initial implementation of toasts, I set the duration to a brief 3 seconds, assuming it would suffice for users to grasp the information. However, during a design critique, fellow designers suggested extending the duration to 5 seconds, which we found to be more user-friendly. This adjustment aimed to strike a balance, giving users enough time to read and interact with the toasts while not causing unnecessary interruptions.

To prevent repeating past errors, we conducted user testing with a small group of six individuals. Our goal was to assess the effectiveness of the newly developed toast component in terms of its visibility and impact on user workflow. The toast was designed to be informative without disrupting the user's activities. Our primary measure of success was whether users noticed the toast. Although the toast is meant to convey important notifications, it should not interfere with the user's workflow.

 Towards the end of this project, the top-center, bottom-center, and bottom-left were the top three candidates for placement. Top-center was eliminated because the SimplePractice community would experience the same problems as before. Placing toasts at the top-center of the screen would also block and compete with future banners. That left bottom-left and bottom-center. I was really torn between the two, but I decided that the bottom center would be best considering that the new navigation was left aligned and certain interactions would result in fly-outs.

We made the deliberate choice not to proceed with the transformation of error banners into toasts. This decision aimed to maintain the effectiveness of error messaging and uphold the principle of user-centric design, where clarity and assistance in error scenarios take precedence. By retaining error banners, we ensured that users would receive comprehensive error feedback, including a clear explanation of the problem and specific calls to action (CTAs) to guide them in addressing the issue. This approach prioritized user experience and problem resolution, aligning with our commitment to providing users with the support they need when encountering errors.

The new form of documentation, as seen in the alert banner audit, success banner audit, and error banner audit, could be considered an upgrade because it brings together the current and updated copy in the same place. This comprehensive approach can help streamline the implementation process for engineering. For instance, the documentation of success banners reveals the use cases, locations, and messages of each instance, making it easier for engineers to understand and implement changes⁠. This method could potentially reduce misunderstandings and thus increase efficiency.

I worked with the content design team to create guidelines for toasts. In terms of zeroheight documentation, most of the visuals were my responsibilities, as well as timing and placement since I focused on these subjects during various design critiques.

Looking back, I'm unsure if I could have done anything better. This was a huge project, even greater than the icon refactor, which I definitely did not expect. Most of the mistakes that I made were centered around scale, scope, and strategy. There was one week during the project when things began to go at light speed compared to the initial pace. To avoid this in the future, I will try to prioritize second-order thinking to anticipate the unexpected. Working in sprints might help a lot as well, even if it is just on a personal level.
